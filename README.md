In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

EDA in Python uses data visualization to draw meaningful patterns and insights. It also involves the preparation of data sets for analysis by removing irregularities in the data.
Based on the results of EDA, companies also make business decisions, which can have repercussions later
.
If EDA is not done properly then it can hamper the further steps in the machine learning model building process.
If done well, it may improve the efficacy of everything we do next.

Using College Distance Data set we did EDA and drawn meaningful insights and visualised them-

1-As college distance incerease education decreases.

2-Rural empact on college and urban empact on college.

3-Empact of parant's education 

4-Age of student
